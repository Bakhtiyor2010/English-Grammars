        <h2>Uses & Examples</h2>

        <h3>Actions continuing up to, or stopping just before, a moment in the past</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>She had been studying for three hours before her friends called.</li>
            <li>They had been playing football all afternoon when it started raining.</li>
            <li>I had been working at the company for five years before I got promoted.</li>

        <h2>Grammar Note:</h2>

        <p>The past perfect simple often <b>emphasises the result</b> of an action:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>She had finished her homework, so she could watch TV. (Focus on the finished homework → result)</li>
            <li>He had cleaned the room before the guests arrived. (Result: room is ready)</li>
            <li>They had built the bridge by last year. (Result: the bridge exists)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The past perfect continuous often <b>emphasises the action</b>, and <b>the time spent on the action</b>, rather than the result:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>She had been studying for three hours before her friends called. (Focus on the studying process and duration)</li>
            <li>He had been painting the house all day, so he was very tired. (Emphasizes effort/time spent)</li>
            <li>They had been walking for miles when it started raining. (Focus on the ongoing activity and duration)</li>
        </ul>
