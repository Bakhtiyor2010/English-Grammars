        <h2>Uncountable Nouns</h2>

        <br>

        <h3>Uncountable nouns are nouns that we cannot count individually. They do not have a plural form and usually take a singular verb.</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>She gave me some useful advice.</li>
            <li>My money is in my wallet.</li>
            <li>The news was a complete shock.</li>
            <li>I need more information about the exam.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of water in the bottle.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>Here are simple rules to know whether a noun is countable or uncountable:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Countable:</strong> You can count it. Has singular and plural forms. Use numbers and a/an with singular.
                <br>
                <b>Examples:</b> one apple, three cars, a book.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                <strong>Uncountable:</strong> You cannot count it individually. No plural form. Often refers to liquids, materials, abstract ideas.
                <br>
                <b>Examples:</b> water, sugar, advice, furniture, happiness.
            </li>
        </ul>
