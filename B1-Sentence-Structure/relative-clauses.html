    <h1>Relative Clauses</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Relative Pronouns</h2>

        <h3>Usage:</h3>

        <p>We use relative pronouns in relative clauses. We use relative clauses to give more information about something, without having to start a new sentence.</p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>

        <p><em>That man over there is called Bill Gates. He started Microsoft.</em></p>

        <p>➡ That man over there, <strong>who’s</strong> called Bill Gates, started Microsoft.</p>

        <br>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Use</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>who</strong> – for people</td>
                <td>What’s the name of the man who created the Internet?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>which</strong> – for things and animals</td>
                <td>The experiment which worked was the last one.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>where</strong> – for places</td>
                <td>This is the town where Albert Einstein was born.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>whose</strong> – to show possession</td>
                <td>That’s the man whose sister discovered a new planet.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br>

        <h3>who (people)</h3>

        <h3>Watch Out</h3>

        <div class="watch-out">
            ✔ We can use <strong>who</strong> for animals when we give them a personality.
            <br>
            Our dog, who’s called Benji, is eight years old.
        </div>

        <div class="watch-out">
            When there is a relative pronoun, remember not to repeat the subject/object.
            <br>
            ✘ What’s the name of the man who <strong>he</strong> created the World Wide Web?
            <br>
            ✘ This is the experiment which I’m doing <strong>it</strong> at the moment.

        <h2>Non-defining Relative Clauses</h2>

        <h3>Usage:</h3>

        <p>Non-defining relative clauses give extra information. The sentence makes sense without the relative clause. That man over there, who is called Bill Gates, started Microsoft.</p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>

        <p>If we remove the relative clause, the sentence still makes sense:</p>

        <p>That man over there started Microsoft.</p>

        <h3>Example Sentences:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>My brother, who lives abroad, is visiting us.</li>
            <li>Paris, where we stayed, was beautiful.</li>
            <li>This laptop, which I bought last year, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Mr. Smith, whose son won the prize, is proud.</li>
            <li>The new app, which is free, is very useful.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Helpful Hint</h3>

        <div class="hint">
            We use commas with non-defining relative clauses.
            <br>
            ✔ Carl, whose sister is famous, is a friend of mine.

        <h2>Defining Relative Clauses</h2>

        <h3>Usage:</h3>

        <p>Defining relative clauses give very important information. If we remove a defining relative clause, the sentence doesn’t make sense.</p>

        <b>Imagine that there are lots of people in a room. Only one of them is wearing a blue shirt.</b>

        <p>The person who is wearing the blue shirt started Microsoft.</p>

        <b>If we remove the relative clause, we won’t know which person it is.</b>

        <p>✘ The person started Microsoft.</p>

        <h3>Examples Sentences:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The student who studies hardest will pass.</li>
            <li>The house that they bought is expensive.</li>
            <li>The book which you gave me is interesting.</li>
            <li>The woman whose bag was stolen reported it.</li>
            <li>The phone that I purchased is powerful.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Helpful Hint</h3>

        <div class="hint">
            • We don’t use commas with defining relative clauses.
            <br>
            • We can use <strong>that</strong> instead of who and which.
